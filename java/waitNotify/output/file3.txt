Dashed Dashed On The Contrary, His Face Split Into A Wide Smile And He Said In A Squeaky Voice That Made Passersby Stare, “Don't Be Sorry, My Dear Sir, For Nothing Could Upset Me Today! Rejoice, For You-Know-Who Has Gone At Last! Even Muggles Like Yourself Should Be Celebrating, This Happy, Happy Day!” And The Old Man Hugged Mr. Dursley Around The Middle And Walked Off. Mr. Dursley Stood Rooted To The Spot. He Had Been Hugged By A Complete Stranger. He Also Thought He Had Been Called A Muggle, Whatever That Was. He Was Rattled. He Hurried To His Car And Set Off For Home, Hoping He Was Imagining Things, Which He Had Never Hoped Before, Because He Didn't Approve Of Imagination. As He Pulled Into The Driveway Of Number Four, The First Thing He Saw — And It Didn't Improve His Mood — Was The Tabby Cat He'd Spotted That Morning. It Was Now Sitting On His Garden Wall. He Was Sure It Was The Same One; It Had The Same Markings Around Its Eyes. “Shoo! ” Said Mr. Dursley Loudly. The Cat Didn't Move. It Just Gave Him A Stern Look. Was This Normal Cat Behavior? Mr. Dursley Wondered. Trying To Pull Himself Together, He Let Himself Into The House. He Was Still Determined Not To Mention Anything To His Wife. Mrs. Dursley Had Had A Nice, Normal Day. She Told Him Over Dinner All About Mrs. Next Door's Problems With Her Daughter And How Dudley Had Learned A New Word (“Won't!”). Mr. Dursley Tried To Act Normally. When Dudley Had Been Put To Bed, He Went Into The Living Room In Time To Catch The Last Report On The Evening News: “And Finally, Bird Watchers Everywhere Have Reported That The Nation's Owls Have Been Behaving Very Unusually Today. Although Owls Normally Hunt At Night And Are Hardly Ever Seen In Daylight, There Have Been Hundreds Of Sightings Of These Birds Flying In Every Direction Since Sunrise. Experts Are Unable To Explain Why The Owls Have Suddenly Changed Their Sleeping Pattern. ” The Newscaster Allowed Himself A Grin. “Most Mysterious. And Now, Over To Jim McGuffin With The Weather. Going To Be Any More Showers Of Owls Tonight, Jim?” “Well, Ted,” Said The Weatherman, “I Don't Know About That, But It's Not Only The Owls That Have Been Acting Oddly Today. Viewers As Far Apart As Kent, Yorkshire, And Dundee Have Been Phoning In To Tell Me That Instead Of The Rain I Promised Yesterday, They've Had A Downpour Of Shooting Stars! Perhaps People Have Been Celebrating Bonfire Night Early — It's Not Until Next Week, Folks! But I Can Promise A Wet Night Tonight.” Mr. Dursley Sat Frozen In His Armchair. Shooting Stars All Over Britain? Owls Flying By Daylight? Mysterious People In Cloaks All Over The Place? And A Whisper, A Whisper About The Potters… Mrs. Dursley Came Into The Living Room Carrying Two Cups Of Tea. It Was No Good. He'd Have To Say Something To Her. He Cleared His Throat Nervously. “Er — Petunia, Dear — You Haven't Heard From Your Sister Lately, Have You?” As He Had Expected, Mrs. Dursley Looked Shocked And Angry. After All, They Normally Pretended She Didn't Have A Sister. “No,” She Said Sharply. “Why?” “Funny Stuff On The News,” Mr. Dursley Mumbled. “Owls… Shooting Stars… And There Were A Lot Of Funny Looking People In Town Today…” "Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone" “So? ” Snapped Mrs. Dursley. “Well, I Just Thought… Maybe… It Was Something To Do With… You Know… Her Crowd.”
