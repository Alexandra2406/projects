Dashed Dashed Mr. Dursley Couldn't Bear People Who Dressed In Funny Clothes — The Getups You Saw On Young People! He Supposed This Was Some Stupid New Fashion. He Drummed His Fingers On The Steering Wheel And His Eyes Fell On A Huddle Of These Weirdos Standing Quite Close By. They Were Whispering Excitedly Together. Mr. Dursley Was Enraged To See That A Couple Of Them Weren't Young At All; Why, That Man Had To Be Older Than He Was, And Wearing An Emerald Green Cloak! The Nerve Of Him! But Then It Struck Mr. Dursley That This Was Probably Some Silly Stunt — These People Were Obviously Collecting For Something… Yes, That Would Be It. The Traffic Moved On And A Few Minutes Later, Mr. Dursley Arrived In The Grunnings Parking Lot, His Mind Back On Drills. Mr. Dursley Always Sat With His Back To The Window In His Office On The Ninth Floor. If He Hadn't, He Might Have Found It Harder To Concentrate On Drills That Morning. He Didn't See The Owls Swooping Past In Broad Daylight, Though People Down In The Street Did; They Pointed And Gazed Open-mouthed As Owl After Owl Sped Overhead. Most Of Them Had Never Seen An Owl Even At Nighttime. Mr. Dursley, However, Had A Perfectly Normal, Owl Free Morning. He Yelled At Five Different People. He Made Several Important Telephone Calls And Shouted A Bit More. He Was In A Very Good Mood Until Lunchtime, When He Thought He'd Stretch His Legs And Walk Across The Road To Buy Himself A Bun From The Bakery. "Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone" He'd Forgotten All About The People In Cloaks Until He Passed A Group Of Them Next To The Baker's. He Eyed Them Angrily As He Passed. He Didn't Know Why, But They Made Him Uneasy. This Bunch Were Whispering Excitedly, Too, And He Couldn't See A Single Collecting Tin. It Was On His Way Back Past Them, Clutching A Large Doughnut In A Bag, That He Caught A Few Words Of What They Were Saying. “The Potters, That's Right, That's What I Heard — ” “ — Yes, Their Son, Harry — ” Mr. Dursley Stopped Dead. Fear Flooded Him. He Looked Back At The Whisperers As If He Wanted To Say Something To Them, But Thought Better Of It. He Dashed Back Across The Road, Hurried Up To His Office, Snapped At His Secretary Not To Disturb Him, Seized His Telephone, And Had Almost Finished Dialing His Home Number When He Changed His Mind. He Put The Receiver Back Down And Stroked His Mustache, Thinking… No, He Was Being Stupid. Potter Wasn't Such An Unusual Name. He Was Sure There Were Lots Of People Called Potter Who Had A Son Called Harry. Come To Think Of It, He Wasn't Even Sure His Nephew Was Called Harry. He'd Never Even Seen The Boy. It Might Have Been Harvey. Or Harold. There Was No Point In Worrying Mrs. Dursley; She Always Got So Upset At Any Mention Of Her Sister. He Didn't Blame Her — If He'd Had A Sister Like That… But All The Same, Those People In Cloaks… He Found It A Lot Harder To Concentrate On Drills That Afternoon And When He Left The Building At Five O'clock, He Was Still So Worried That He Walked Straight Into Someone Just Outside The Door. “Sorry,” He Grunted, As The Tiny Old Man Stumbled And Almost Fell. It Was A Few Seconds Before Mr. Dursley Realized That The Man Was Wearing A Violet Cloak. He Didn't Seem At All Upset At Being Almost Knocked To The Ground.
